/*
The built-in function setTimeout uses callbacks. Create a promise-based alternative.

The function delay(ms) should return a promise.
That promise should resolve after ms milliseconds, so that we can add .then to it, like this:
*/

function delay(ms) {
    return new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, ms));
  }
  
  delay(3000).then(() => alert('runs after 3 seconds'));


/*
Whatâ€™s the output of the code below?
*/

let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
  resolve(1);

  setTimeout(() => resolve(2), 1000);
});

promise.then(alert);

// the answer is 1. because only the first call of reject/resolve is taken
